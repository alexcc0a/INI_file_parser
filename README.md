**"INI File Parser"**

The INI file parser class provides a single template function that allows the user to retrieve the value of a variable within a specific section.

If the file does not contain a value for the requested variable, the program throws an exception. If there are issues reading the file or the file is invalid, an exception is raised with relevant details.
